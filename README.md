# Testing Various AI Models for Game Play
This project uses TensorFlow to train self-play of a game (Space Invaders). 

It will first use a single layer perceptron. 

Then, a convolutional neural network. 

Then, a recurrent neural network.

Then, someday, reenforced learning and Q-learning. 

It is written in python.
